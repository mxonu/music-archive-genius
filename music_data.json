got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it",

        "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much",

Oh\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one, and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\n[Outro]\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven",

All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)\nMCs get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of \nshame\nYou fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)\nYou're witnessin' a mass-occur\nLike you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\n\"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"—that's all they say, lookin' boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy\nHey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy\nI'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit\nGet outta my face, lookin' boy!\nBasically, boy, you're never gonna be capable\nOf keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod\nThis planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off, then I'm reloadin'\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'\nBut I got your mom deep-throatin'\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothin' in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes\nTo maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case 'cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come tryin'\nTo censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from \nThe Mathers LP 1\n when I\nTried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (\nJ.J. Fad\n)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for \nSatan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard—be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?",

(\nAh\n)\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nBitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker\nFat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble\nAs you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles\nKanye West samples, here's one for example\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nUh, the best living or dead hands down, huh\nLess talk, more head right now, huh\nAnd my eyes more red than the devil is\nAnd I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch\nMatter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this\nDo the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists\nAnd my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit\nArguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit\nI heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane\nChi nigga, but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said, \"This the number to dial\nIf you wanna make your number one your number two now\"\nMix that Goose and Malibu, I call it \"Malibooyah\"\nGoddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style\nKnow that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?\nWhatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now\nKnow I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now\nThink you motherfuckers really, really need to cool out\n'Cause you'll never get on top of this\nSo, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this\nHave you ever had sex with a pharaoh?\nAh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus\nNow she claiming that I bruised her esophagus\nHead of the class and she just won a swallowship\nI'm livin' in the future so the present is my past\nMy presence is a present, kiss my ass\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West, Kanye West & JAY-Z, JAY-Z]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (\nYeah\n)\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know \nI'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 3: JAY-Z]\nSasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness\nGoblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience\nQuestion, what do these things all have in common?\nEverybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nConquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense\nNonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is\nNone of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen\nI still hear fiends scream in my dreams\nMurder, murder in black convertibles, I\nKill a block, I murder the avenues, I\nRape and pillage your village, women and children\nEverybody want to know what my Achilles heel is\nLove, I don't get enough of it\nAll I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers\nAll I see is these niggas I made millionaires\nMillin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air\nAll I see is these fake fucks with no fangs\nTryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins\nI smell a massacre\nSeems to be the only way to back you bastards up\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\n\n[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]\nPull up in the monster, automobile gangsta\nWith a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka\nYeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka\nYou could be the king, but watch the queen conquer\nOkay, first things first, I'll eat your brains\nThen I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs\n'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do\nHair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do\nMonster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe\nYoung Money is the roster and a monster crew\nAnd I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face\nAnd if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't\nSo let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?\nBut my features and my shows ten times your pay?\n50K for a verse, no album out\nYeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it\nHotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent\nTony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it\nNicki on them titties when I sign it\nThat's how these niggas so one-track-minded\nBut really, really, I don't give an F-U-C-K\n\"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake\"\n\"She on a diet,\" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake\nAnd I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play\nJust killed another career, it's a mild day\nBesides, Ye, they can't stand besides me\nI think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday\nPink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash\nI think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast\nNow look at what you just saw, this is what you live for\nAh, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!\n\n[Outro: Justin Vernon & \nCharlie Wilson\n]\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (\nHeaded home\n)\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (\nNo\n)\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (\nHead home\n)\nI, I crossed the limelight (\nNo, the limelight\n)\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home\n\n[Produced by Kanye West, Mike Dean & Plain Pat]\n[Video directed by Jake Nava]",

I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\n\n[Chorus]\nUh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again, another critic writing report\nI'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork\nStill suicidal, I am\nI'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand\nI'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head\nAnd I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch\n(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G\nI just wanna know if my father would ever like me\nBut I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me\nA motherfuckin' goblin\n(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nNow the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit\nDead",

You not my first, who gives a fuck?\nYour other one? Evaporate, we celebrate\nYou under oath, now pick a side and if you don't\n(Run, run, run, run)\nI'll pick you both\n(Run, run, run, run)\nIt's not a joke, murder she wrote\n\n[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]\nAyo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear\nI live life with no fear, except for the idea\nThat one day you won't be here\nI will not fetch the ball\nEyes are green, I eat my vegetables\nIt has nothin' to do with that broad\nBut if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well\nI got a plan, but the walkin' depends\nIf you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym\nEyes on the prize, got weight on my chest\nThat I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them\nCan't be in the picture if it got no frame\nAnd let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame\nBlow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—\nI wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one\nNot the other one, keep it on the low\nI'm in my right mind, keep it on a high\nJanis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em\nFour on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store\nGrab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door\nGet the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned\nNew magic wand",
